## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a front-end developer focused on building scalable, maintainable component libraries using React and TypeScript. This repository showcases my work in creating reusable UI components that help streamline front-end development and promote consistency across web applications.

My goal is to develop design system-friendly libraries that support fast development without compromising on flexibility or accessibility. Using Reactâ€™s component-based architecture, I build modular UI elements that are easy to compose and customize. With TypeScript, I ensure type safety, better tooling support, and improved developer experienceâ€”making it easier to work with components at scale.

Each component is designed with reusability and clarity in mind, following best practices in naming conventions, props management, and composition. I pay close attention to accessibility (a11y), ensuring that components are keyboard-navigable, screen reader-friendly, and compliant with WCAG standards.

This repository includes a growing library of components such as buttons, modals, inputs, dropdowns, and form elements, along with clear documentation, stories (using tools like Storybook), and usage examples. I also include unit and integration tests to ensure reliability and help catch regressions during development.

The codebase is structured for maintainability and easy integration into various front-end projects. Whether for internal tools or production-grade web apps, these components are built to be lightweight, performant, and adaptable to different design systems or themes.

Iâ€™m passionate about crafting great user interfaces through thoughtful, composable code. Whether youâ€™re looking for inspiration, looking to contribute, or simply exploring how to structure a front-end component library, I hope you find this repository useful.

Feel free to explore, clone, or contributeâ€”I'm always open to feedback, new ideas, and collaboration with other developers working in the React and TypeScript ecosystem.
